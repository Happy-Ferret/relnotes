The `run.py` script generates the Aurora release notes page. This
project will be improved in the future to handle all of Firefox's
release notes pages.

Instructions:

1. Make sure you have the `relnotes.sqlite` database file in the root of this project.
2. Install the requirements (`pip install -r requirements/compiled.txt`)
3. Run `python run.py <product> <version> <channel> > out.html` replacing
   <product> with the product name and <version> with a Firefox version, and
   <channel> then channel name

The file `out.html` contains the generated release notes page.
